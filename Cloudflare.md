# WSBLearns Chapter 1 : An Introduction to the Cloud Computing Economy
### Goals
- Answer "What am I investing in when I risk money with CloudFlare?"

# My Motivation
CloudFlare is releasing and bolstering support for streaming, video, and communications as a security-first cloud provider in the following week. This, on top of its rapidly growing developer platform, is consequential for many reasons as a market-mover in the industry.

# In Short
CloudFlare so far has been shredding forward across multiple technical markets competing against by:

- Competing marketshare against CISCO, Palo Alto Networks, and other hardware customers

- Offering a way to not lock your organization into a big tech vendor

- Promoting security and challenging Big Tech's direction with web development

- Forming positive relationships with Shopify, Facebook, JD, Twitter, Baidu, TOR, and Microsoft

- Pioneering the ease-of-use privacy movement with 1.1.1.1 and distributing VPNs.

- Growing a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and secure network across the world

- _Providing a development platform that promotes the use extremely powerful and 'cutting edge' web computing._ **-> YOU ARE HERE**

- Creating a better internet.

_**Cofounder of NPM - a primary pioneer in the cloud market**_

# The Thesis
The economic value and convergence between e-commerce, global networking speeds, and video advancements is not anywhere close to realized. There has been an acceleration toward this reality but it's still early in the overall economic development cycle. This timeframe has been accelerated greatly due to global market lockdowns and further risk of lockdown.

Physical and monetary assets being virtualized has recently been accelerated in importance and this will have positive effects, across time, on businesses that focus on securing those assets in its time spent delivering on multiple ultra-high-speed networks across the world. Computing is getting cheaper and easier to distribute in rather extreme ways and the execution of these ideas is happening right now.

Infrastructure that support these interactive ecosystems will be growing at incredible rates. This market is **BIG** and no one or two players will be large enough to capture the market. It ranges from manufacturers, energy departments, web products, hospitals, governments, and so on. Security is serviced differently based on the industry. This much is obvious - a hospital will clearly protect patient records more closely than a manufacturer controlling the runtime of their high-speed machining assembly line.

_**CloudFlare prioritizing hospital security over web retailers**_

The need for secure video, transactions, VR, and user experiences will be dramatically shot up and this is evident across many exciting technologies like Apple VR, Google Gaming, Square Banking, Facebook Shops with VR shopping, Microsoft software automations, and government developments.

NET is one of the best positioned companies to pioneer this market at scale.

# Market drivers & a brief history of modern computing
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37036296/83951016-9bb58200-a7e3-11ea-8398-151ec1df2bae.png)

The history of CDNs took a much larger turn when YouTube and Netflix became big players in data production and needed to cooperate with Internet Service Providers to manage the new dam and  tunnels of water that the market had created.

As many of you know, video data is large and streaming high quality videos at high speed to millions of users in real time was no laughing matter. Around this time you also began to see new products in ESports like Twitch.tv which would "stream" video. 

What had happened was that tech companies discovered a more cost effective way of delivering video and it was through controlling the actual pipeline. You would receive atomized content as needed rather than waiting for blocks of video to be received on your end (this was problematic in early Youtube days with broadband and DSL)

The paradigm began to shift. Cloud computing and asynchronous models began to gain steam in the developer profession. We began a defining chapter of web optimizations that still continue today with serverless computing, real-time data, and growing user-experiences. At this time you began to notice that you no longer had to refresh your web page to receive new data. Remember when Facebook started to notify you rather than you checking your notifications? Do you remember when you had to check your email?

Today, developers are able to create or distribute product and services using networking and data center functions. This is largely what is recognized as cloud and serverless computing. This is has many consequences but primarily allows for unbelievably fast responses and avenues for user experiences.

# What is serverless computing?

Serverless computing allows a 25 year old developer like me run 5 different businesses on my dinky little Macintosh while I let Google and Cloudflare run my servers under an extremely cheap pricing model. That is a revolutionary change for software. It is one of the bread and butter of SaaS, IaaS, and other cloud style businesses where many business problems come out of the box for you.

# Other competitive advantages of network and cloud computing
The reason Snapchat did not gain any traction outside of the US was because Facebook provided a fundamentally faster service across WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook's investment in Akamai and its personal networking infrastructure allowed them to create a product that was fast, cheap and would work in various rural or economic conditions. Snapchat never stood a chance in the global social media landscape as a result.

# What's special about CloudFlare as a network?
What CloudFlare specifically offers against its competitors is its **privacy-first approach** and its quality of engineering. CloudFlare is essentially a distributed private content delivery network (pCDN) with a massive infrastructure effort to send data around the world safely and cheaply. 

This is fundamentally consequential as we are seeing massive nations tackle issues with how data can be utilized or privatized.

Privacy and speed sells. A Cloudflare sells it at the best price.

# Deep market relationships
CloudFlare has had large scale investments, partnerships, and business ventures with organizations like:

_**JD Cloud and Chinese infrastructure, which will inevitably boom with revenue from video scaling, contentious privacy, e-commerce and infrastructure**_

# So what does this mean for CloudFlare?
## The missing puzzle piece: CloudFlare TV and Cloudflare Streaming
### Target: Enterprise, profits, generosity, and long-term market capture.

A big piece that's missing from Cloudflare's economic puzzle is the release and support of distributed video and video development. 

_**Piece 1: Easy to use, distributed, private, secure networking**_

# My record
I'm fairly conservative in my choice to purchase option or stock. I'm a software engineer that's passionate about education and have really enjoyed exercising my knowledge-base during this investment time. Usually i get really excited about a stock or two at best per year based on certain global developments. These stocks are selected based on powerful and consequential market relationships or competitions occurring in the arena and by simply just participating in the market as much as I can myself.

I have made a fair amount of money with

- Bitcoin & AMD's computing relationship (Bought bitcoin at 2k, AMD at $11)

- E-Commerce and Facebook's growing relationship with small businesses (my first options reached 20x on FB)


currently investing heavily in:

- Privacy [**CloudFlare, Big Tech, US, China, and global development**]

- Automation, manufacturing, and battery improvements [**Panasonic, FANUC, Texas, Mexico and Japan**]

- Mexican-American trade [**Kansas City Union, USMCA, and the Mexican economy**]

- Virtual Reality, gaming, AI with user-experience support, and fintech [**Zoomers & you**]
